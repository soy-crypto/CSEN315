# Execution Command

The way to execute my code is:  

``` bash
fill in here
```

# Extra Algorithms

You may implement extra algorithms such as: 
- Least Recently Contacted
- Weighted Round Robin

For each extra algorithm you're implementing, please fill out the following template: 

- Algorithm Name: 
  - Explanation
    - Least Recently Contacted works by doing `XYZ` 
  - Comparison with Power of 2 in a distributed environment:
    - Least Recently Contacted performs (better | worse) than Power of 2 in a distrbuted environment because `XYZ`


# Grading

The grading is based on the completion of the following criteria _and_ your ability
to explain your code. I suggest you leave many comments that explain the what and why of the code
so you're prepared for when I ask you about it. 

You are required to complete each criteria in this assignment. 

| Points | ID     | Test Criteria                                                                        |
| -----: | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      5 | CHARTS | Your code generates charts (a long with instructions on how to regenerate them)      |
|      5 | PO2    | Create an experiment that pits the "Power of 2 Random Choices" against "Round Robin" |

You can include other load balancing algorithms, as long as you explain the algorithm. Each additional algorithm and explanation will be 5 extra points. Although the explanation is about distributed load balancing, your implementation can assume a single load balancer.
